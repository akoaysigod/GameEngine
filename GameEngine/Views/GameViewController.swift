/**
 The `GameViewController` is a controller for stuff. It probably won't do much but it's required for iOS. Pretty much just 
 set up the `GameView` and `Scene` from here. After that???
 
 A basic setup in viewDidLoad() would look something like 
 
 ````
 super.viewDidLoad()

 let view = self.view as! GameView
 scene = Scene(size: view.bounds.size)
 view.presentScene(scene)
 ````
 */
public class GameViewController: VC {
  public var scene: Scene!

  override public func loadView() {
    view = GameView(frame: Screen.main.nativeBounds)
  }
}
