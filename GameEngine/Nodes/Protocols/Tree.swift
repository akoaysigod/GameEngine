/**
 The `Tree` protocol is used by any object that wishes to be part of the tree hiearchy with the root more than likely being a `Scene`.
 
 The basic implementation of this is in the `Node` class where the hiearchy is more or less a group of sets so that a `Node` cannot be added multiple times.
 It would still be possible to add a node to another parent but I'm not sure what will happen or if that even makes sense. 
 Probably best to avoid doing stuff like that.
